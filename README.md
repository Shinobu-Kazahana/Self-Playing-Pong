# Self-Playing-Pong
Classic Pong played by two computers



## What is this?
Have beeen doing game dev work for a couple of years now but had never done THE game(PONG), didnt get to impliment scoring. In this version two computers play against eachothe. Both computers have a set of constraints in order to trigger loss. This constraint being maximum paddle move speed on the computers side. The ball however gets much faster as time progresses. So i wanted to answer the questions all things being equal.

 * which computer loses first? 
 * Is it the random ball factors that influence it the most?
 * How long until one computer loses?


### What did I use?
Did this one using vanilla JS, no canvas on the html, simply moving the elements using css position properties dynamically controlled through Javascript.
